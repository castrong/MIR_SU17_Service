How to run this example:

More involved process if you need to customize your build process / deal with libraries:

You create the files:
	1. helloworld.pyx (python code that will be converted to c)
	2. setup.py

Then run the line:
	python setup.py build_ext --inplace
to compile your code into c. Then go into the normal python environment and type

import helloworld

which will import it like a normal package. You then can run commands like:
helloworld.hi() and it will run it =D


Less involved process:

1. Create the file helloworld2.pyx
2. Go into python and run the following lines:
import pyximport; pyximport.install()
import helloworld

great, it's imported again! If you want to have it try to 
turn the standard library / other normal libraries things into c
code if you import them, then run:
pyximport.install(pyimport = True)
